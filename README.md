# Desi Meme Generator 🇮🇳

An open-source, AI-powered Streamlit application that empowers users to create and share memes in their local Indian languages. Built as part of the **Summer of AI 2025** by Swecha, this project aims to collect culturally rich, informal language data through a fun and engaging meme creation platform.

## 🚀 Overview

**Desi Meme Generator** is designed to:
- Provide users with meme templates that reflect Indian culture (movies, sports, politics, etc.)
